const filenaming_recommendations = `Recommended File and Data Collection Naming Practices
-----------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------

Use data file and directory names that express the information that researchers need to locate data collections of interest and to indicate the differences between collections (both current and possible future ones). The following are some hard-won practices for naming your data collections and data filenames, and adding information to a data collection Readme file (hopefully without being too legalistic). All data files should be made publicly available and in FTPS or HTTPS directories for easy access, even if also available through other services and databases. These directories have the advantage of allowing easy download (using wget for instance) of whole directories. Each instrument team should strive to capture the full scientific content of their instrument in a self-describing scientific format (CDF, netCDF, HDF, FITS) with full documentation and metadata, sufficient for someone in the far future to be able to fully apply its scientific value without the need for specialized software.

The following sections provide recommendations for laying out the directory hierarchy, naming the dataset or collection, naming the data files, and finally creating a Readme file for the collection. In general, use all lowercase text, except for specific files and subdirectories, and use a limited character set, to ensure maximum compatibility across computer platforms and processing languages. Use times in one of the ISO 8601 formats, such as 20160215T050357.123, or 2016046T050357.123, with or without the T, or standard internal time formats such as CDF\_TIME\_TT2000 (ns from J2000 in Terrestrial Time). Use well-known extensions, spacecraft and instrument short names, and datatypes where available.

Directory Hierarchy Conventions
-------------------------------

Directory hierarchy should flow from high level to specific: project/mission/spacecraft, instrument, data collections, time ranges. Time range directories (yearly, monthly, daily) should be chosen to keep the number of files per directory below 1000 to avoid delays in directory display. In general, avoid the use of levels (L0, L1, L2) as directories, but instead include them if needed as a subfactor in distinguishing between datasets in the data collection directory level names, perhaps prepended to make sorting easier (l2\_gms\_62ms).

So a typical data URL would be something like  

    https://repositoryURL/pub/data/spacecraft\_dir/instrument\_dir/general\_product\_dir/specific\_product/date/file.format

For instance, a data file in the ISEE-1 plasma wave spectrum analyzer dataset on SPDF's archive is at  

    https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/isee/isee1/waves\_pwi/sa\_pwi/1982/isee1\_pwi\_sa\_19820101\_v01.cdf

A researcher can follow from the ISEE mission to ISEE-1 spacecraft to the Plasma Wave Instrument to the spectrum analyzer data stored as CDF files in yearly directories.

Instrument Directory Naming Conventions
---------------------------------------

Instrument directories can be the instrument\_acronym (and perhaps add institution if needed), but if possible expanded to include the instrument type for users not familiar with the specific spacecraft. For examples, waves\_pwi or particles\_epact. [SPASE Measurement Types](http://www.spase-group.org/tools/parser/jaxb/api229/org/spase/parser229/MeasurementType.html) are recommended. Datasets from multiple instruments can be named with combinations, such as magnetic\_electric\_fields, or  "combined" or "merged" if they involve a number of instruments. Composite/combined/merged data collections are best stored in directories at the instrument level (de/de2/combined\_magnetic\_electric\_fields/ and de/de2/combined\_plasma\_neutrals/). Data collections for housekeeping, engineering, ephemeris, orbits, attitude or combinations go at the same level as the instruments. Directory names should be meaningful to the wide community, and use written-out words and underscores if abbreviations are too cryptic or easily confused with other uses of the same.

Include a readme file (perhaps named 00readme.txt to appear first in directory listings, see below) with brief explanations of the data collections and their relationships. 00readme.txt may be placed in every directory for navigation and content identification (perhaps aliased to the top-level one). Connect data collections across several instruments with links in the 00readme.txt files and web pages.  Combined data collections at the higher level can have place-holder directories under each instrument involved, that includes a 00readme.txt pointing to the actual data directory. Instrument directories contain data collections directories, and may also include other directories, such as software, documents, catalogs, attributes. Archived web sites may be stored under the documents directory, perhaps with the name website.

Data Collection Directory Naming Conventions
--------------------------------------------

Data collection names should include info on parameters, temporal and spatial resolution, compression and file format with enough specificity to allow other variations later (so we can later add other data collections only differing by one of these), using the order:  project\_instrument\_parameters\_resolution\_format\_compression

These fields or sections are separated by underscores, and parts of a section can use hyphens to improve readability. Use English words where meaningful, except for short forms listed below. If desired, the level (L0, L1, L2 or kp (key parameter), sp (summary parameter), etc.) may be prepended to the data collection name to sort by these levels.

Data File Naming Conventions
----------------------------

Filenames contain the data collection name and add time and version information and file extension, such as project\_instrument\_dataform\_time\_version.fileformat

Alternatively, the ISTP format uses a slightly different ordering: project\_dataform\_instrument\_time\_version.fileformat

Filenames must carry the project and instrument for uniqueness and clarity. Use only alphabet characters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods, so the names are valid on all common file systems. Use all lower case filenames unless absolutely necessary, to avoid confusion with files that differ only by case.

### Field descriptions used in filenaming and data collection naming

project/source/mission/spacecraft

Shortest string that clearly describes but distinguishes from other spacecraft and projects (Metadata dictionary names: ISTP: "Source", SPASE: "Observatory")

Unless a hyphen is clearly needed, missions and instrument names with numbers should be put together; for instance, RBSP-B should be encoded as rbspb.

instrument

Instrument name, 'all' for all instruments of a project, "combined" or "merged" for subsets (Metadata dictionary names: ISTP: "Descriptor", SPASE: "Instrument")

dataform/datatype

Characteristics of the dataset that distinguish it from others (including plausible ones created later) using some meaningful combination of parameters, resolution, format, compression (Metadata dictionary names: ISTP: "Datatype", SPASE: "ProviderResourceName", "ProviderProcessingLevel")

*   Parameters: AC vs DC, AVG for average, or ISTP K0, K1, H0, etc. 
*   If desired, the level (L0, L1, L2 or kp (key parameter), sp (summary parameter), etc.) may be prepended to the data collection name to sort by these levels (such as l2-gms-62ms).
*   Resolution: temporal resolution using time codes: ms, min, s, hr, day, week, month; round off resolutions for varying resolutions; preferably note all time resolutions in the data collection. Examples: 500ms for 0.5sec resolution, 6s for 6sec, 5min, 2hr for 2 hour, 1day for daily
*   Format: ascii, cdf (include in data collection directory name, but data files use this as file extension)
*   Compression: zip, gz, tar.gz (include in data collection directory name, but data files use this as file extension)

time

begin time (or begin and end time if required) in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ("t" between day and hour if desired) and always 4-digit years. Time preferably uses month and day (MMDD) rather than day of year (DDD) for consistency.

*   YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS (truncating where sensible)
*   YYYYDDDTHHMMSS (where DDD is day of year, with 001 = Jan 1)
*   YYYYqx (for quarter year: q1, q2, q3, q4, but discouraged)

version

reprocessing version; preferably uses a format of "vNN" where NN=01, 02, 03, etc. Some projects use a more complicated versioning scheme, such as Release, Major, Minor (v02.13.004). (Metadata dictionary names: ISTP: "Data Version", SPASE: "")

file format

(Metadata dictionary names: SPASE: "Format") usually in the file extension, including these:

*   standard science format: ".cdf", ".hdf", ".fits"
*   ASCII data format: ".asc" (not ".txt" which is reserved for text descriptions)
*   binary data format: ".vmsbin", ".os2bin", ".idl", ".xdr", ".ieeebin" (reserve ".dat" for unknown or uncommon binary data files)
*   software: ".for", ".c", ".pro", ".class", ".pas", ".pl"
*   document text format: ".txt" (".doc" for MS Word files only!)
*   graphics format: ".gif", ".jpeg", ".ps", ".png", ".tiff"
*   appended compression/collection: ".gz", ".tar.gz", ".tar.Z", ".zip", ".sit" (".bin" is MacBinary format or WordPerfect)  (Metadata dictionary names: SPASE: "Encoding")

It is important to distinguish text files from binary ones when the user is transferring them via FTP or the user wants to examine them. EBCDIC, BCD and 36bit file formats are discouraged. The varying fields of filenames can be described with the [Heliophysics URI Template Standard](http://tsds.org/uri_templates).

Appendix: 00readme.txt template
-------------------------------

00readme.txt file in each directory describes the directory contents and points to directories below and back to higher directories and other info.

*   Keep short (point to 00readme\_long.txt when longer file required to contrast various instruments or datasets).
*   Use < > around URLs and "/" at end for directories.
*   Use URLs to point to software and documentation.
*   Users may come into hierarchy at any level so each 00readme.txt should stand alone and place the user in hierarchy.
