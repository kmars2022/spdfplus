NOTICE: September 2022: GOES magnetometer (MAG) high-resolution data is now available in CDAWeb for GOES-08 to GOES-17, covering the period between 1995 and present. The GOES MAG subsystem consists of fluxgate magnetometer instruments monitoring three orthogonal components of the geomagnetic field at geosynchronous orbit (L = 6.6) with high-resolution sampling rate (G8-15: 2 Hz and G16-17: 10 Hz). 

August 2022: The PSP data have been extended up to April 2022, covering the rest of Orbit 11 and part of the inbound leg of Orbit 12. Two new FIELDS datasets are added. They are Level 2 Antenna Electronics Board (AEB) data and Level 3 Simplified Quasi-Thermal Noise (SQTN) data using the Radio Frequency Spectrometer (RFS) spectra. Pitch angles are included in the ISOIS datasets whenever FIELDS data are available. EPI-Lo calibrations have been updated for apertures with thick entrance foils.

March, 2022: A new CDF version 3.8.1 distribution is now available.  See the [CDF home page](https://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/) for links to the software/documentation and the [3.8.1 Release Notes](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/cdf38_1/linux/Release.notes).

*March, 2022:* A total of 17 Level 2 Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) datasets from the Solar Orbiter mission have been added to CDAWeb. February 17, 2022: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data have been extended to November 2021, which covers Orbit 9 including Encounter 9 with perihelion in August 2021 and Venus Flyby 5 in October 2021. Two new SPAN-Ion data sets are added. As a mission focusing on solar encounters, the time coverage varies greatly between PSP data sets. Please check the [PSP inventory plot](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/sc_inventory_plots/PSP_Inventory.png) and [annual inventory plots](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/sc_inventory_plots/) for details.

*January 2022:* The ICON Level 2 data products (in netCDF files) for MIGHTI, IVM, FUV and EUV are available via [SPDF HTTPS](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/icon) and in [CDAWeb](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Likewise, the MAVEN Level 2 data products (in CDF files) for STATIC, SWIA, SWEA, and SEP are available via [SPDF HTTPS](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/maven) and in [CDAWeb](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

The MMS Level 2 data products are available via [SPDF HTTPS](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/) and all data sets are available in [CDAWeb](//cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The range of publicly available MMS data will continue to be updated weekly.`;
