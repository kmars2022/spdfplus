[SPDS Concept Document](cncptdoc.html)

The purpose of this Concept Document is to present the initial findings
of the SPDS Steering Committee to the potential system users, data
suppliers and NASA management. It is critical to the short-term
evolution of the system and the long-term success of SPDS that the
system concept and evolving system plans reflect the views of the wider
space physics community.

[SPDS Rice University Workshop Report](wkshprpt.html)

Approximately 75 scientists gathered for a community-wide workshop on
the Space Physics Data System (SPDS) in early June at Rice University,
Houston. The workshop considered community needs for access to data and
made recommendations to guide NASA's Space Physics Division (SPD) in
managing space physics data in the 1990s and beyond.

[Iospheric Thermospheric Mesospheric (ITM) Data Evaluation Panel
Report](itmreport.html)

This report contains the ITM Panels recommendations for prioritizing the
restoration of deteriorating data sets.

[Space Physics Cosmic & Heliospheric Data Evaluation Panel
Report](CH_report.html)

The Cosmic and Heliospheric (C&H) Data Evaluation Panel (DEP) was
charged with the task of identifying and prioritizing important C&H data
sets. It was requested to provide C&H community input to the Space
Physics Division (SPD) for a program of revitalizing data holdings. As
detailed in this report, the panel has identified substantial areas of
concern and generally assigned highest C&H priority to Voyager, Pioneer,
Helios, IMP-8 and ISEE-3 data in that order.

[Sun-Earth Connection Study Team Report, SSDS TWG River Bend Workshop,
July 1998](/pubs/river_bend.html)

This report describes the system architecture and organization of a data
service to manage the data associated with the Sun-Earth Connection
theme within the context of the NASA Space Science Data System. It
proposed a distributed service in which the data sets are managed at a
number of sites by scientists actively involved in data analysis.
