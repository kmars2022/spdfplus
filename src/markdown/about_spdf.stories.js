# INTRODUCTION

The Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) leads in the design and implementation of unique
multi-mission and multi-disciplinary data services and software to strategically advance NASA's solar-terrestrial
program, to extend our science understanding of the structure, physics and dynamics of the Heliosphere of our Sun
and to support the science missions of NASA's Heliophysics Great Observatory.

Major SPDF efforts include multi-mission data services such as CDAWeb and VSPO, science
planning and orbit services such as SSCWeb, data tools such as the CDF software and tools, and a range of other
science and technology research efforts. The staff supporting SPDF includes scientists and information technology
experts.

The SPDF is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD U.S.A. and is a
project with the [Heliophysics Science Division of Goddards Sciences & Exploration Directorate](//hsd.gsfc.nasa.gov) .
The project is headed by [Robert M. Candey.](mailto:Robert.M.Candey@nasa.gov)
