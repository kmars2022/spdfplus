## Submitting Data to the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF)

A SHORT SUMMARY

For non-solar missions, instruments and other data-producing work funded
by the NASA Heliophysics program, archiving the resulting science data
is a charter responsibility of the SPDF. We prefer but may not require
data to be supplied in a self-describing format (typically CDF or
netCDF) and following the [ISTP/IACG
Guidelines](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/sp_use_of_cdf.html) for data
organization and standard metadata . We need all additional descriptions
of the instrument, dataset and processing (particularly algorithms) to
make the data fully understandable for long-term and correct use by
non-experts. For flight missions and instruments, we prefer to get
copies of data as they become public. NASA heliophysics missions are s
also usually required to work with NASA to create [SPASE
descriptions](https://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov/spase_metadata.html) of all
datasets.

IN MORE DETAIL

SPDF serves as the NASA Heliophysics active Final Archive for
heliospheric, magnetospheric and ITM missions, plus some legacy data
from earlier solar missions. SPDF's charter is the accurate and complete
capture, long-term preservation, and long-term accessibility of
heliophysics data from NASA-funded missions, plus select non-NASA data
important to NASA heliophysics strategic science objectives. Our
priority is higher-level and more generally useful digital data
products, preferably calibrated high-time resolution in physical units.
We also welcome long-term valid and useful supplemental summary graphics
and other products. NASA usually requires archiving lowest level
(Level-0) products with SPDF as well. Under the current [Heliophysics
Science Data Management policy](https://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov/), SPDF's
responsibilities also include all heliophysics data that were formerly
archived at the [National Space Science Data Coordinated Archive
(NSSDCA)](https://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/). [NSSDCA is responsible for
data only available offline on media until restored and sent to SPDF].

We work directly with all potential data providers to ensure the capture
of data products, with the goal that our submission processes are easy
for data providers to follow and enable archived data to be broadly
accessible and usable. We work directly with flight missions and
instrument teams as early as reasonable (preferably pre-launch) to
ensure a good mutual understanding of what data should be archived, and
when and how such data can best be submitted to SPDF. We have many tools
and services that can contribute to meeting mission objectives and
improving the use of mission data by the broad research community within
the context of data from other missions. To utilize these capabilities
and to best ensure all data are fully archived, we strongly encourage
missions to archive their data and working documentation with us as data
is produced and not wait until final data products and documentation are
produced at the end of a mission.

SPDF strongly prefers data supplied in standard but non-proprietary
formats (i.e. digital data in CDF, netCDF, FITS, HDF) or as ASCII files
for sufficiently simple data. We also strongly encourage the use of
standard metadata, such as the [ISTP/SPDF CDF metadata
standards](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/sp_use_of_cdf.html). In all cases,
complete archiving requires appropriate metadata and other documentation
sufficient to allow the correct and independent long-term use of the
data by future researchers. NASA heliophysics missions are also usually
required to work with NASA to create [SPASE
descriptions](https://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov/spase_metadata.html) of all
datasets.

To discuss or arrange any specific data submission, please contact the
SPDF project scientist (Robert Candey, robert.m.candey@nasa.gov,
301-286-7707) or any member of the SPDF science curation and support
staff
([NASA-SPDF-Support@nasa.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:NASA-SPDF-Support@nasa.onmicrosoft.com?Subject=Feedback/Support%20from%20SPDF)).
For data and document submissions, SPDF prefers that data be submitted
electronically, either by SPDF retrieving files from a
provider-identified online site or by a provider pushing data to an
SPDF-designated ingest area. Where necessary, SPDF can handle data
submitted on other media, such as DVDs.
